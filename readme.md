## us-elections-2020 ##

A simple python script to simulate possible outcomes in the 2020 US presidential elections.

### Method ###

We use state-by-state polling data to generate the likelihood a candidate will win that state. (In the code, the likelihood is a probability represented by a simple normal distribution.) We can optionally introduce a global bias on the polling data, biasing the results towards either candidate. More sophisticated models are possible.


Polling data is obtained from [270towin](https://www.270towin.com/2020-polls-biden-trump/).

### Discussion ###
Prelimary results suggest the polling data strongly favours Democrats.
